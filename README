This library is different from a real thread management library because it acts in a way much
closer to forking. While each lwp is sharing most of the same memory, they run more independently
like child processes would. Importantly, they are treated as separate processes from the view
of the main process, and are thus kept in check with the ptable. A real thread management library
would work more concurrently.

To improve this library, a series of different schedulers could be pre-existing to choose from,
so that the programmer is less likely to have to implement his own.


I did not get as far into this assignment as I would have liked. Hopefully it will be the strike
I need to not let it happen again. I have numbersmain executing the first 5 prints and yields,
but I have not been able to resolve how to properly set up the scheduler or return to the threads
after they yield.
